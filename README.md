# Raspberry Pi Camera

## Description

A short script file to interface with a webcam connected to a Raspberry Pi.

## Usage

There are four commands:  

`start` starts a new video recording  
`stream` starts a new video livestream  
`stop` stops current video recording or livestream  
`restart` stops current video recording and starts a new video recording

Video recording files are saved as `go.mpg` in current directory.

## Background

This file was created as part of my [senior capstone project](https://github.com/saichikine/autoboats) to remotely track autonomous boats. However, the file is abstract enough to be used for any project involving a webcam and a Raspberry Pi!
